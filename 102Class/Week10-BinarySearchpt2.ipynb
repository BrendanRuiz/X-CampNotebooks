    "In last weeks lesson, we learned a new technique to improve our linear search. We recognized that if we have a sorted list of items, we do not need to do a linear search in order to find what we are looking for. Instead we can divide our list into two sections and cut the search space in half by comparing the middle value to our target value. \n",

One of very important applications we will learn in the future is called 'binary search on answer'. This is a process where we choose test values in a range of possible answers, and simulate them to try and find the best possible answer. We will not learn this technique right now, but let's see a small example to get you exposed to all the possibility the binary search allows. \n",

Here left = 0, right = n. Next we can do our binary seach. When we want to check to move left or right in our search space, we simple need to test middle * middle to see if it is too big or too small. \n",
