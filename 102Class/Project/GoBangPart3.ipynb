    "1. Create a list a-f and use the index of the letter to help find the position. Add the position to 9 to get its real position. \n",
    "1. Use ASCII value. Figure out the number you need to subtract by to get the correct position. Remember ord() gets ASCII value. \n",
    "1. Convert from Hexadecimal to Integer value. If you have any experience with hex numbers you may realize the board choices are an exact match. You can look up how to convert from hex to int and take this value. You may find [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/209513/convert-hex-string-to-int-in-python) post of use. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember!! Board is 0 indexed. That means after you convert you x and y values you need to shift them down. For example a move of ff would represent the position (15, 15). This index does not exist in the board since board[14][14] is the bottom right-most value.\n"
