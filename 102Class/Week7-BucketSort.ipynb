From our comparisons and tests, we realized that many of our sorting methods have similar performance (speed), but differ slightly in certain cases. With Bucket sort we will again solve the same problem of sorting a list, but in a very different way than what we have seen before. "

Therefore our design is a 2D list (Matrix). "
