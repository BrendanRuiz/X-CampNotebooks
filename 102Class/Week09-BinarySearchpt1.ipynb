    "From our previous lesson about merge sort, we learned a very important lesson. We learned that sorted lists are very powerful and we can use them to solve problems in more efficient ways. For merge sort we start out with N sorted lists (all of size 1) and merged them together. At each merge step, we knew the lists a and b we were combining were already sorted. Due to this property, we could always take the smallest index of a list and know it is as low as we can go. \n",
